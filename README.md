# RED, a generic FPS with a Tron esc. aesthetic
The name is pretty self explanatory(but for the sake of being elaborate, I've added more info in the readme file). 

i've gotten the game to a point where it is now playable, but i intend to create more content and optimisations for it. 
The file formatting is a little bad, i know, but keep in mind that when i tell unreal to delete something, it only really complies like 50% of the time,
which is quite annoying.


Note that re-complilation after changing any instance of the enemy will break break the set color scheme for that instance. make sure to, after making any changes, replace the character into the level.
