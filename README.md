# Grid raider, a generic FPS with a Tron esc. aesthetic
The name is pretty self explanatory(but for the sake of being elaborate, I've added more info in the readme file). 

i've gotten the game to a point where it is now playable, but i intend to create more content and optimisations for it. 
The file formatting is a little bad, i know, but keep in mind that when i tell unreal to delete something, it only really complies like 50% of the time,
which is quite annoying.


Note that re-compilation, either manually or by playing in the editor, will break any instances within the level. make sure to delete and re-place these instances back into the level after making any changes.
